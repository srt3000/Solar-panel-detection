How to run:
Open the code in Google Colab, 
Change the input images path to your labelled images path in google drive and run the code. 

# Dataset 
Prepared from google earth images and labelled using labelbox, 
Dataset contained 2000 images but only 101 images were used for training
Ping me if you want the dataset
